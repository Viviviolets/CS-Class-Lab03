# CS-Class-Lab03
This assignment has four objectives:  
1. to compose methods to operate the array, familiar with the index of an array
2. to pass array as a parameter to a method
3. to use the result of the previous computation to produce result of new computation  
4. to follow all applicable rules of previous programming assignmen


Write a method that takes as input an array of integers and returns the index corresponding to the
person with the lowest time. Run this method on the array of times. Print out the name and time
corresponding to the returned index.
Write a second method to find the second‐best runner. The second method should use the first method
to determine the best runner, and then loop through all values to find the second‐best (second lowest)
time.
